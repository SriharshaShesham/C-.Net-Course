Calculation should be in a different class
Program.cs
{
    BasicCalculations()
    {
        {
            1.Addition
            2.Substration. Substract 2nd Number from first 
            3.Multiplication. Multiply 1st number by second
            4.Division. Divide 1st number by second
        }
    }
